# Ktor Database

My application is built using several technologies to achieve its functionality. These technologies include:

- **Database:** My application uses a database to store and retrieve data. Specifically, it uses the [Exposed library](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) for Kotlin, which provides a SQL library with ORM support.

- **FreeMarker:** My application uses FreeMarker as a template engine for generating HTML pages dynamically.

- **Routing:** My application uses the [Ktor routing library](https://ktor.io/docs/routing.html) to define and handle HTTP routes and requests.

- **Serialization:** My application uses the [Kotlin serialization library](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) to serialize and deserialize data between the application and the client.

- **Ktor framework:** My application is built using the [Ktor framework](https://ktor.io/), which is a Kotlin-based web framework for building asynchronous servers and clients.
